<p>Checkout the fllowing lesson</p>
[Lesson: Concurrency in Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html )

## In A nutshell

<p>You are dealing with three separate threads in this case, or rather three groups of threads</p>

* Initial Thread(s)
* The event dispatch thread, and
* Worker threads || Backroung Threads

<p>You don't have to create your own thread!! Just use whattever is there. I bet things are quite similar with JavaFX</p>
